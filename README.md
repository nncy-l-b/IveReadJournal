# IveReadJournal
A journal of the books I have read

On a trip to Seattle, a four our flight from Chicago, I bought a book and had bought on a previous long flight. Uggh.
This journal records books I've read and my thoughts on them for future reference.
Since I tend to devour and not savor a book, this is the best way to keep track of what I have read.
